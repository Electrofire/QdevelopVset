 *  	VISUALIZATION
 *  	This class contains the reference to a Model and the information
 *  	required to generate a visualization.
 *  	This class is parallel to a visualization window.
 *  	Since a single model can be opened in different visualizations
 *  	the class should have a reference to the concrete model and
 *  	have their own specification details.
 *  	This may include but is not restricted to:
 *  		- camera(zoom, position, etc)
 *  		- color scale
